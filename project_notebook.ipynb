her,\\r\\n\\r\\n258\\r\\n00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:51,038\\r\\nshe took hold of his finger,\\r\\nthe way a baby does.\\r\\n\\r\\n259\\r\\n00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,614\\r\\nHe told my mother

myself the same question why do you love that woman i dont get it i actually get it shes beautiful powerful and most of all shes rich what are you trying to say exactly that and you what does she like about you oh that that i get its because my sir tonio ah maybe its your job cause miss monica is known for dating accomplished men where are you working im currently jobless so youre not working now because youre with miss monica thats why im opening a business right which you havent even thought about i know what i want yes you do my rich boss what are you getting at i wasnt getting at anything uh i just wanted to know if im after monicas money if im just using your boss you said it not me i am not using monica but thats what youre getting at the truth because if i misunderstand you once

just end this okay fine all right thank you youre welcome wow i felt that she had a lot of resentment you know you two need to mu mu make up mommy hey sis wheres daddy what happened his sides started

prove that i can do it that im deserving of the promotion please miss monica please give me another chance dont talk to me talk to anton hes the client and as far as im concerned he doesnt wanna see you he doesnt wanna have anything to do with you so good luck in trying to convince him to take you back what you got something to say im too busy counting all of monicas money right now please forgive me please give me another chance because i really need this job here a peace offering and this too mmm thanks tep are you mad at me cause your insults really hit home you know it was my decision to wait for you i made that choice eventually i realized that i should be mad at myself because i chose to be stupid im sorry that i left you hanging you know i completely understand that you had to board a ship for work but to leave without saying a word you didnt talk to me or come and see me one last time i found that hard to accept and i waited for you i even told myself youll explain everything to me because you love me but come to think of it i realized you never once told me you loved me so it was stupid of me to assume that you loved me oh well i guess when someone courts you it doesnt mean he loves you i did love you oh well the past is the past lets leave it behind us its been seven long years anyway its better this way because if we ended up together i might have been a hindrance to you hmm you might not be as successful as you are now tonio im really sorry im sorry for everything i said its okay were good mmm high five kiss mmm hi im stephanie asuncion i will be your pr specialist and you are tonio anton bugayong anton it doesnt sound like me that name doesnt suit me not yet but we will do something about that just relax thats the kind of bar you and miss

when i worked on the cruise ship i was assigned to the kitchen thats where i learned to cook hmm so thats how miss monica fell for you by putting a spell on her food during her cruise of course not thats not even where we met we met in orvieto italy what in italy yeah i only spent one year on the ship then i hopped off i ended up working as a caregiver then i met my employer he looks like your grandfather thats why i felt at ease taking care of him did you have a hard time taking care of him not really but its the loneliness that will get you there arent many filipinos there plus seor luigis vineyard was in a provincial area oh last year his closest friends visited him monica was with them but after a few days seor luigi passed away monica was the one who helped me she really surprised me she didnt mind doing the work washing the dishes serving the funeral guests really miss monica did yeah really she doesnt seem to be the type hey shes not like that thank you i think youre talking about a different girlfriend tonio you just dont know monica like i do so why did miss monica tell me that she met you on a cruise ship maybe because thats where we bonded when seor luigi died he left me a lot of money and he left strict instructions for me to go on vacation so when monica told me she was going on a cruise i went with her thats where you got to know all of monica meaning thats where you meddled with monicas mufflers mama mae so so what im just worried about you i just dont want you getting hurt by tonios answer because you know mama mae whatever tonio says will have no effect on me anymore and obviously thats where they they first you know right first what first time you meddled meddled with the mufflers whose monicas my gosh what are you saying ouch disgusting sorry my god im sorry ill just shut up and drink my coffee hello babes i mean babe how are your mufflers i mean your its mama maes fault you know you may not be feeling hurt but i am hurting for you mmm mmhm its going well im learning a lot shes just a bit temperamental and strict oh my god anton is that you yes babes thats me ants its me not thats me sorry babes uh babe do you

why not have your date with mtv after the meeting if you want i can make reservations for you tep what if i set up a furniture shop instead thats what i really want anyway its just monica who thinks its a waste of money huh its not a waste of money youre very good at that i promise you once your shop opens up ill be your first customer really sure ill even do pr work for you for free really uhhuh you know i think you just need to show your work to miss monica im sure shell be impressed why not bring her to your province oh why are you still up im just editing a video presentation for a client mmm uh by the way who drove you home my new client he looks like like tonio mmmm that was tonio mommy hes your client my god steph hes nothing but trouble you need to get away from him while you can unbelievable go to the province with you what why ill introduce you to my family ill also show you my woodwork i want to prove to you that setting up a furniture shop wont be a waste of money i just cant see myself running a highend bar is this because i missed dinner last night so youre backing out is that it monica im not interested in setting up a bar then study up on it why do you keep insisting on this furniture thing monica youre my girlfriend but you dont seem to have faith in me unlike steph who has complete faith in me ants sorry i have faith in you okay im gonna reconsider that furniture thing but i cant go to the province with you maybe next time okay move my meeting with mr reyes to pm and tell him im on my way okay yes maam miss monica yes can i ask you something okay make it fast because im busy what i saw your car outside the restaurant last night why didnt you come in follow me actually i kind of feel guilty about it i just wish life was less complicated when i met him in italy i was still heartbroken over andrew so when anton told me he wanted to come with me on the cruise i was okay with it normally i wouldnt have allowed it because i barely knew him but you know he made me laugh he made me feel beautiful and special have you ever felt that way steph his rural attitude his corny humor even his bad grammar all of that was so wonderful that was back then when we were still in paradise but not now when were back in the real world its just better to introduce him to family and friends as a fellow passenger that i met on a cruise ship theres no way that i would tell them im in a relationship with a seaman turned caregiver its embarrassing he had an honorable job steph dont be so naive after all were in the world of pr and thats not the point this is the first guy who is willing to do anything for me who is willing to change for me thats why i really want this relationship to work but you confronting me like this and planting seeds of hope in his furniture shop miss monica if you could just give anton a chance i did i told him i would reconsider but only after ive been proven wrong that its not going to be a waste of money catch my drift steph i think this is going beyond what miss monica is asking of you this is girlfriendlevel effort for a guy you claim to be just a friend steph im just concerned for you this might be another mu for you a misunderstanding with major uncertainty come on lets grab some lunch okay i might lose some weight oh gosh im super excited im ready for the beach see look at me i put on sunscreen oh show a little excitement i cant believe you finally you get to introduce me to your family mmmm tep youre in uniform what are you doing here do we have a session no but i heard mtv cant go with you to the province to see your furniture yeah im kind of bummed out about it mmm no no no youre not allowed to mope im here because im going to make sure that mtv will still see your furniture so instead of her coming over to see your work your work will come to see her okay ill do it tep yeah mmm huh mmm mmm oh ah got it yes mmm huh theres theres more no you still got food give it here i want some more you finished it mama mae you might get fat yes braised pork tep lets eat you can sleep in my room tonight huh oh my gosh so naughty what about you ill sleep on the couch ill be fine there too bad you

you almost didnt board your ship remember huh uncle thats not true tep might believe you remember when you were in manila you were drunk every night and every time you got drunk you sang tep tep tep tep tep with matching tears thats too much tep might believe you too much you were too drunk they even had to dunk your head in a drum of water just to get rid of your hangover hey steph got drunk too hey you got drunk tep tonio you didnt know about that because he didnt want to talk about steph back then okay enough she reeked of booze hyro right mom wait so what if she got drunk i wasnt drunk that was when she came back to look for you the second time she came back susan three months later tep did you really come back here oh she came back wait you tease them like tonio doesnt have monica

keep in mind tonio determination is not the same as love hi babe you look great mmm stand up straight how are you um are you ready i want to introduce you to my friends come on anton monica told me you plan to open a bar have you picked out a location were still looking for a place where we actually anton is still doing his research we already know that theres a lot of bars that are open right now so we wanna make sure that his stands out you know anton he loves to take calculated risks come on anton i know you worked abroad so im sure you know about taking risks yeah in fact ive been to many countries i started working as a actually anton has worked in so many places when i met him he was working for a big wine ranch in italy and i thought he was done with it but you know once a businessman always a businessman actually im not sure if im a good businessman at all but youre right but why im used to taking risks thats what i did when i jumped off a ship to become an illegal immigrant oh he was a seaman before thats interesting it was hard but a lot of people helped me thats why i have so much respect for wealthy people like you so when i got rich i told myself that i should never feel ashamed about where my money came from because that was a blessing to me a blessing given to me by a kind person who accepted me for who i was youre really lucky then thank you for the wonderful evening please excuse me i have to go uh excuse me ill be back i think theyre having a fight okay anton anton what was that all about you humiliated me in front of my guests i just defended myself because i felt so small i didnt embarrass you monica you embarrassed me i was just protecting you from them protecting me why because theyre judgmental they didnt even mind my bad english and my being unsophisticated but you did monica you think they werent judging you they were just being nice to you but they were already judging you in their minds but youre judging me to my face you couldnt even let me speak for myself because youre afraid everything i say will embarrass you oh my god why are you being so juvenile about this is this about stephanie again steph has

name is tonio this isnt easy for me tonio this isnt easy for me either monica to admit that im not enough that im so flawed in your eyes the pain i feel right now is the same as when my mother left me the same pain i felt when i had to leave steph because i felt that i wasnt good enough for her because i love you i let you change who i was thinking that once im finally a good fit for you you might love me wholeheartedly but now i realize that will never happen we will never be a good fit for each other no matter how much i study english no matter how hard i try to fit in with your friends and no matter what clothes i wear im still nothing but trash to you im so tired monica are you saying that its over im sorry daddy steph come here steph its okay its okay to get tired to get hurt its even

to you and i and i dont wanna go home watch any video online with opensubtitles free browser extension osdblinkext guys guys you dont understand this isnt just any wet tshirt contest this is mickey greens sixth annual breastfest hundreds of girls forget that thousands of breasts all pressed together on a small wet stage with the three of us right there celebrating our manhood mugs of beer in one hand buckets of water in the other im not sure im ready for that im ready im not sure i can go im not that comfortable being in the same room with wet breasts last time you were in a room with a wet breast was when you took a steam bath with your grandfather i remember eddies grandfather boy he was stacked come on eddie itll be fun i dont know youre unbelievable you wont go to strip joints you hate bachelor parties youre disgusted by sleaze in any form whats wrong with you i just get so embarrassed it might not kill you to occasionally expose yourself to people exposing themselves you really want me to go oh come on eddie itll be a great night something youll tell your grandchildren about it could bring you one step closer to having grandchildren well ok for the kids donna i cant believe you made a uturn in the middle of the lincoln tunnel i signaled what happened i forgot my watercolors we wasted two hours going crosstown twice during friday rush hour i had to go back mirandas an artist an artist without paint is like a day without orange juice were going to the movies you guys want to come huh tonight do you have any plans well um uh uh actually we were planning onon doing so uh something but were just not quite sure what that is what are you guys doing tonight eddie what out with it me come on eddie were going to a bar where therell be women women in shirts shirts that are not dry you going to a wet tshirt contest i didnt say that eddie how could you how could you and how could never mind thats disgusting entering the contest is out of the question oh please aldo heshes just making a joke not that its a joke that you could enter cause you could you could win i mean im guessing if you wanted to if you didnt want to then of course you wouldnt id be rooting for you in a tasteful way of course congratulations aldo youve managed to pervert the pillsbury doughboy everybody chill a little its just a harmless nights entertainment its not harmless to humiliate women these women are not humiliated they get free beer prizes and a lot of compliments and if theyre really lucky bronchitis i cant believe that they still have wet tshirt contests i thought that fad was over a long time ago thats the thing about towns like belmar they dont go in for that trendy stuff like hot oil wrestling or whipped cream aerobics these towns stick with whats real whats enduring what works look at this hes like a scummy charles kuralt you dont get it do you aldo a wet tshirt contest isnt good clean fun these women are human beings not objects to be hosed down put on display and judged like pigs at the state fair its an honor to be one of those pigs you know what the truth is its not even their fault theyre just the damaged products of a repressed society theyve grown up being told a womans body is a dark forbidden secret thats why they jump at every opportunity to peek so so if society had a healthy attitude you guys wouldnt cram yourselves into some dark sweaty room and drool all over each other trying to stare at some strangers breasts you know what miranda youre right society does need to change and hopefully someday it will but until then we got some drooling to do dont you want to get a tan i want to do it gradually the umbrellas a big step for eddie last week he stayed under the boardwalk i dont want to get too tan too soon how will that happen you never take your shirt off at least im not the whitest one on the beach look at that guy thats a septic tank tan monitor if i fall asleep throw a hat on me big night last night huh some were bigger than others hey why not go after eddie he was there too you should really go after aldo he brought along a supersoaker to hit any spots they missed sounds like you had fun well no i mean i wasnt hollering or shouting i just watched yeah like this i didnt go up to the contestants with paper towels and offer to pat them dry thats funny how about when aldo yelled youll put an eye out with those do you think those were her own no they came with the shirt miranda oh my god are you crazy should i enter them i cant believe this you believed in it last night you paid money for it whats wrong with it today miranda someones going to see you what are you worried about zack these are no big deal not after friday nights yabbo mania is she dressed yet miranda why are you doing this because these guys are full of crap they cant look at breasts they have to leer at hooters like theyre not even attached to a person ok i see theyre attached would you put your top back on if every woman took her top off at the beach breasts wouldnt be considered these mystery prizes anymore and that would be the end of wet tshirt night ill never go again i promise would you come out of there they are just breasts i guarantee if you look at them long enough theyll get really boring is zack looking no will you come on eddie sit down is it that hard to get used to no no no no no no good its very natural of course it is now the rest of society has to catch on oh no oh my god all right donna what the hell hi how was the beach it was great never again ow eddie took his shirt off congratulations eddie what was the occasion he was just following the crowd what are you talking about oh arden you shouldve been there it was the first time in my life that i felt really free there was nothing between me and the wind you mean you two were topless when i think of how many years ive spent covering myself up hold it you two sat on belmar beach topless yeah i missed it i was on the phone my aunt theresas in the hospital that bitch wait a second didnt anybody say anything to you guys an old woman walked by and told eddie to cover up she noticed i was turning red so when we going back anytime we didnt do it to give anybody a cheap thrill it was a political statement and if thats what it takes to change society im ready to walk into the ap with my top off ill start the car come on aldo grow up huh and what happened to you he went to the beach a little boy and came home a man if aunt theresa lives im never talking to her again arden want to try it tomorrow oh no thank you i believe in what youre saying but my seventh grade teacher sister mary katherine gave me a wise piece of advice show your boobs burn in hell the more i thought about what miranda said the more hypocritical i felt it took a few minutes to get used to seeing them topless but after a while its no big deal its just another part of the body thank you zack no thank you miranda so whats for dinner all this freedoms got me hungry knock on door can i help you im looking for miranda halpern and donna shipko oh my god the police are you ms halpern and ms shipko yes im ms halpern whats the problem officer a complaint was filed against you two for indecent exposure you were observed in a seminude state cavorting about at the public beach uh excuse me officer i was there and i can testify that there was no cavorting there was sleeping there was sunbathing there was a little panicking maybe but definitely no cavorting sorry i have a witness who would challenge that who mrs hilda wennig oh no she saw me drop a plum pit on the sand once and ran after me with a kayak paddle she also carries a polaroid at all times i think shes done some of her best work here oh my god im a cavorter these are very interesting officer i think i just found my christmas cards get away i need those sir regarding these photos i have one request could you crop me out all we did was take off our tops to sunbathe that earns a fine in this town that fine is absurd and puritanical i have no intention of paying it let me get my purse donna look miss you violated town ordinance and you have two choices on monday morning report to the local precinct to pay the fine or contest the charges at the county courthouse lots of luck let me ask you something where were you last night when pairs of breasts were being hosed down at mickey greens bar for the enjoyment of this towns depraved male population second row im fighting this did you hear that indecent exposure i guess that creep considers wet tshirt night decent exposure im a criminal donna stop crying you have nothing to be ashamed of wearing a uniform doesnt make someone right were right if were going to fight this we got to do it through solidarity we can win this thing but we have to stick together this is all your fault did you know that in at least six states laws have been enacted to prohibit wet tshirt contests did you know our lease says we can be evicted for lewd behavior lewd i didnt see you checking the lease last week when aldo brought home that movie bend over betty hey she was a gymnast im taking this to court this is a perfect example of the hypocrisy of this place you made the front page of the asbury park press oh great overexposed thats the headline summer renters charged with indecency look hilda even got a photo credit wait let me see this do they mention my name oh yeah good i hope they spelled it right they spelled all our names right men shouting hey why dont you guys go do something constructive like a cave painting oh oh whats going on out there oh nothing just a pack of slobs theyre drunk and disgusting and some of them mooned me hey i know those guys you are those guys i dont think i can take much more of this hey sweetheart aah youre going through with this yep lets get our stuff we can beat the sunday traffic and avoid being hung naked from our willow tree the whole summer is ruined what happened they wouldnt serve me at the dairy queen they said they dont serve people like me then this little boy dumped a great mr misty on my shoe all set hey hows donna doing shes still in her room shes been up there all day you have my number in the city why in case they give you one phone call thanks good luck miranda i hope you win if i can help let me know im with you all the way how about one quick peek to remember what im fighting for get out of here hi hi what you doing getting my stuff together for tomorrow im paying the fine i figured you would miranda why do you have to go through with this i cant help it donna when i see that somethings wrong i want to change it but look what its doing to everyones summer i dont care about everyone what about me i know you like this stuff its like a mission for you you have a cause and you know youre right even i know youre right then why wont you come fight this with me because my parents live near here my father reads the press every night after work if we fight this hes going to keep reading about his daughter taking her top off on the beach and i got to live with them sooner or later you got to stand up for whats right even with your parents its not just them its me you like it when you walk down the street and people think there goes that activist no troublemaker no pain in the ass thats it so so i dont i like it when i walk down the street and people think what a nice person or shes always so happy and i dont care about wet tshirt contests or taking our tops off at the beach because the truth is neither of them really affects my life but it does affect your life donna it affects all women everywhere i dont know miranda my life is going to work and answering phones and living at home and sitting on a train two hours a day its hard enough to be happy without trying to change the world now for a few months i get a chance to spend my weekends down the shore with my two best friends and thats whats really important to me miranda ive never asked you for anything please just pay the fine tomorrow for me i cant donna hi donna where were you well be late for work how long could it take to pay a fine i didnt pay the fine what i decided that if miranda felt so strongly about this i should stick by her i went in to see this old creepy judge i said that this was a town of hypocrites and that we were tired of living by mens twisted perverted rules sometimes we get pushed too far and we have to take the law into our own hands like thelma and louise and they can fine us and they can arrest us and they can even throw us in jail but they cant shut us up ever bravo where were you our case got called i had to go in there without you i paid the fine you what i paid the fine you wanted me to pay the fine i paid the fine oh miranda you paid the fine she paid the fine you paid the fine for me and you didnt pay the fine and i didnt pay the fine i didnt pay the fine i told off the judge and he found me in contempt and im going to go to jail and this is all your fault advertise your product or brand here contact wwwopensubtitlesorg today'"

pororo whom he treats like his sibling he sent him out of the house because you have a dog allergy i cant believe it it doesnt make sense he left behind all of the amazing girls who are lined up this is an unbelievable situation exactly unless sin joon young is crazy why would he like me oh my this unni seems quite all right at least you cooly acknowledge what you should i love that aspect of you i know they say that the prince in the fairy tale married cinderella but honestly at least cinderella is nice hella earnest and upright im nice too and hella nice earnest and upright recently i think joon young seems slightly unhealthy last time during a drama filming he hit his head really hard is his brain possibly swollen they say that if your brain swells you cant think normally i should take him to the hospital sometime soon hey seriously stop it thats not something to say with me sitting right here do you seriously not remember what you yelled at our joon young if sin joon young isnt just playing with me if hes sincere if he really likes me what should i do when joon young goes to the hospital you should come get a checkup too unni im sorry ahjussi but could you back up again and go to the back door have you been well you couldnt even eat right im sorry ill bring it soon sin joon young is really sick brainstem glioma yes it seems like the situation isnt good so surgery will be difficult sin joon young himself is rejecting all treatments his mother doesnt know yet that hes sick right no he asked to keep this a secret from his family and company joon young and his mom i feel

completely different now love should only be between people who live in the same world as each other where the lifestyle is the same and what they eat and wear are all the same people who are looking towards the same place together so what is it that you want to tell me please hold on to my noona youre the only one who can get her mind straight please that in your eyes the tears are overflowing is only natural when did you wake up you seemed to be sleeping so i didnt wake you after you close your eyes try to think it must be from the wind passing by when should i let go your manager let me in through the back door the reporters are in front of the main gate how long should i hold on nine and a half halfhalfhalf its beyond understanding its okay now my fingers are thick so it doesnt hurt much today again ive lost the place to go to where are you going arent you going to eat its just a day of wandering a while i worked so hard to make this to feed him then never mind dont eat it ill eat it all whatever as long as it tastes good oh its salty seriously but am i a patient with a transmittable disease why does he always avoid me if hes mad at me he should look at me and tell me why

a right to go crazy once and for him to go get some air oh no eul pd you changed your title from nations golddigger to nations juliet just overnight can you not bear to live if you dont look at those comments of course joon young is alo is not alone hes together with his manager pd no eul should already be back in seoul so if you dont believe me why don you try calling her im here right if our joon young really likes pd no eul ill just die right in front of you yes if our joon youngs eye for women really only amounts to that ill give up my life and the entertainment industry in a wink
